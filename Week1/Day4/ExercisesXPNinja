// Exercise 1 : Checking The BMI
// Instructions
// Hint:
// - You must use functions to complete this exercise, to do so take a look at tomorrow’s lesson.

// Create two objects, each object should hold a person’s details. Here are the details:
// FullName
// Mass
// Height

// Each object should also have a key which value is a function (ie. A method), that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of each person

// Outside of the objects, create a JS function that compares the BMI of both objects.

// Display the name of the person who has the largest BMI.


const person1 = {
    FullName: "Rudolt S",
    Mass: "60",
    Height: "175",
    BMI: function x(){
        return (this.Mass/Math.pow(this.Height,2));
    }
}

const person2 = {
    FullName: "Maxime A",
    Mass: "70",
    Height: "180",
    BMI: function c(){
        return (this.Mass/Math.pow(this.Height,2));
    }
}

function compareBMI(p1,p2){
    if(p1.BMI() >p2.BMI()){
        return (`${p1.FullName} has a higher BMI`);
    }else{
        return (`${p2.FullName} has a higher BMI`);
}
}

compareBMI(person1,person2);



// Exercise 2 : Grade Average
// Instructions
// Hint:
// - This Exercise is trickier then the others. You have to think about its structure before you start coding.
// - You must use functions to complete this exercise, to do so take a look at tomorrow’s lesson.

// In this exercise we will be creating a function which takes an array of grades as an argument and will console.log the average.

// Create a function called findAvg(gradesList) that takes an argument called gradesList.

// Your function must calculate and console.log the average.

// If the average is above 65 let the user know they passed

// If the average is below 65 let the user know they failed and must repeat the course.
// Bonus Try and split parts 1,2 and 3,4 of this exercise to two separate functions.
// Hint One function must call the other.


const grades = {
    A:56 ,
    B:12,
    C:32,
    D:98,
    E:67,
    F:56
}

stud.values

function findAvg(gradesList){
    let sum = 0;

    for (const key in gradesList){
        sum += gradesList[key];
    }
    // let avg = sum/Object.keys(gradesList).length;
    return (sum/Object.keys(gradesList).length);
    
    //checkPass(avg)
}

let avg = findAvg(grades);
console.log(`Average is ${avg}`);

if (avg <65){
    console.log("Fail")
}else{
    console.log("Pass")
}


function checkPass(avg){
    
if (avg <65){
    console.log("Fail")
}else{
    console.log("Pass")
}

}
