//Exercise 1 : The World Translator

//Instructions

//Hint: Use Switch Case

//Ask the user which language they speak.

let msg = prompt("whick language do you speak:")

//Convert the user’s answer to lowercase, so that all the user’s inputs will be accepted in the if statement. For example “english” or “English” or “ENGlish” ect…”
let answer = msg.toLowerCase()

//Create a few conditions :

switch (answer){

//If the user speaks French : display “Bonjour”
  case "french":
  console.log("Bonjour")
  break;
//If the user speaks English : display “Hello”
  case "english":
  console.log("Hello")
  break;

//If the user speaks Hebrew : display “Shalom”
  case "hewbrew":
  console.log("Shalom")
  break;
  
//If the user doesn’t speak any of these 3 languages: display ‘01110011 01101111 01110010 01110010 01111001’
  default:
  console.log("01110011 01101111 01110010 01110010 01111001")
  break;
  }
  
  
  
  //Exercise 2 : The Grade Assigner


//Ask the user for their grade.
let grade = Number(prompt("What is your grade"));

//If the grade is bigger than 90, console.log “A”
  if (grade >90){  
  console.log("A")
  }
//If the grade is between 80 and 90 (included), console.log “B”

  else if (grade <= 90 && grade > 80){ 
  console.log("B")
  }
//If the grade is between 70(included) and 80 (included), console.log “C”
  else if (grade <= 80 && grade >= 70){
  console.log("C")
  }
//If the grade is lower than 70, console.log “D”
  else{
  console.log("D")
  }
 
 
 
// Exercise 3 : Verbing

//Instructions

//Prompt the user for a string. It must be a verb.
let msg = String(prompt("Enter a verb"));

//Example:


//  The string is : "swim" , your program should console.log : "swimming"
//  The string is : "swimming", your program should console.log : "swimmingly"
//  The string is : "go" your program should console.log : "go"

if (msg.length >=3){
 if(msg.slice(-3)===""ing){
//If the length of the string is at least 3 and the string ends with “ing” add “ly” to it’s end.
  console.log(`${msg}ly`)
 } else {
   //If the length of the string is at least 3 and the string doesn’t end with “ing”, add ‘ing’ to the end of the string.
 console.log(`${msg}ing`)
 }
}else{
//If the length of the string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
console.log(msg)
}
