//Exercise 1 : Age Difference

//Instruction

//Given the years two people were born, find the date when the younger one is exactly half the age of the older.
//Notes: The dates are given in the format YYYY


let year1 = Number("2000");

let year2 = Number("2005");

let diff = year2 - year1;

console.log(`year younger brother is exactly half age is ${year2 + diff}`);


//Exercise 2 : Zip Codes

//Instruction

//Harder exercise
//Hint : This exercise has 2 parts. First, do this exercise without Regular Expressions, then do it using Regular Expressions

//While working in a Post Office you must have the clients’ zip code in order to send them their letters.
//Ask the client for their zip code and console.log “success” or “error” based on the following rules.

//Zip codes consists of 5 numbers

//Must only contain numbers

//Must not contain any whitespace (spaces)

//Must not be greater than 5 digits in length


let zipCode = promp("Input zip code:");
const contWhiteSpace = str.indexOf(" ");


if(zipCode.lenght ===  5 && zipCode.indexOf(" ") === False && isNan(zipCode)===false && isFinite(zipCode)== True){
console.log("Sucess")
} else {
console.log("error")
}


// Regex 


if (/\s/.test(zipCode) && /^[0-9]{5}/.test(zipCode)){
console.log("sucess")
} else {
console.log("error")
}


/*
Exercise 3 : Secret Word

Instruction

Harder exercise
Hint : Use Regular Expressions

Prompt the user for a word and save it to a variable.
Delete all the vowels of the word and console.log the result.
Bonus: Replace the vowels with another character and console.log the result
a = 1
e = 2
i = 3
o = 4
u = 5

*/

let word = prompt("Input a word:");
//const regexVowel = /[aeiou]/gi

//console.log(word.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, ''));



//console.log(word.replace(regexVowel));




//let character = {a:1, e:2, i:3, o:4,u:5 };

//console.log(word.replace((/[aeiou]/gi, ''),(character.[/[aeiou]/gi, ''])));



// example work out by ayal
///

const a = /a/ig;

const e = /e/ig;

const i = /i/ig;

const o = /o/ig;

const u = /u/ig;

let word = prompt(`Enter a word: `);
const vowelsMap = {a: 1, e: 2, i: 3, o: 4, u: 5}
