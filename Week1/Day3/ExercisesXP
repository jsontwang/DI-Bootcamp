/*
Exercise 1
*/

//Create 2 variables, x and y. Each of them should have a different numeric value.
//Write an if/else statement that checks which number is bigger.
//Example :

let x = 5;
let y = 2;

//You should display:
//x is the biggest number

if (x > y){
  console.log("x is the biggest number")
} else {
  console.log("y is the biggest number")
}


/*
Exercise 2: Chihuahua
*/
//Instructions

//Create a variable called newDog where it’s value is “Chihuahua”.
let newDog = "chihuahua";

//Check and display how many letters are in newDog.
console.log("letter in newDog is:" + newDog.length)


//Display the newDog variable in uppercase and then in lowercase (no need to create new variables, just console.log twice).

console.log(newDog.toUpperCase())
console.log(newDog.toLowerCase())

//Check if the variable newDog is equal to “Chihuahua”
//if it does, display ‘I love Chihuahuas, it’s my favorite dog breed’
//else, console.log ‘I dont care, I prefer cats’

if (newDog ==="chihuahua"){
console.log(`I love ${newDog}, it's my favourite dog breed`)
} else{
console.log("I don't care, i prefer cats")
}

// Exercise 3: Even Or Odd

//Instructions

//Prompt the user for a number and save it to a variable.
let num = Number(prompt("Inout a number"))

Check whether the variable is even or odd.
If it is even, display: “x is an even number”. Where x is the actual number the user chose.
If it is odd, display: “x is an odd number”. Where x is the actual number the user chose.

if (num % 2 ===0){
  console.log(`${num} is an even number`)
} else{
  console.log(`${num} is an odd number`)
}


// Exercise 4: Group Chat

//Instructions

//Below is an array of users that are online in a group chat.

const users = ["Lea123", "Princess45", "cat&doglovers", "helooo@000"];

//Using the array above, console.log the number of users that are connected to the group chat based on the following rules:
//If there is no users (the users array is empty), console.log “no one is online”.

if (users.length === 0){
  console.log("no one is online")
}

//If there is 1 user, console.log “<name_user> is online”.

if (users.length === 1){
  console.log(`${users[0]} is online`)
}

//If there are 2 users, console.log “<name_user1> and <name_user2> are online”.

if (users.length === 2){
  console.log(`${users[0]} abd ${users[1]} is online`)
}


//If there are more than 2 users, console.log the first two names in the users array and the number of additional users online.
//For example, if there are 5 users, it should display:
//name_user1, name_user2 and 3 more are online

if (users.length > 2 ){
  console.log(`${users[0]}, ${users[1]} and ${users.length - 2} more are online`)
}
