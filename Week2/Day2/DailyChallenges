# Instructions
# Challenge 1
# Ask the user for a number and a length.
# Create a program that prints a list of multiples of the number until the list length reaches length.
# Examples

# number: 7 - length 5 ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

# number: 12 - length 10 ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

# number: 17 - length 6 ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

userNumber = input()
userLength = input()

    # userNumber = 7
    # userLength = 5
numberList = []

for i in range(1,userLength+1):
    numberList.append(userNumber*i)

    print(numberList)






# Challenge 2
# Write a program that asks a string to the user, and display a new string with any duplicate consecutive letters removed.
# Examples

# user's word : "ppoeemm" ➞ "poem"

# user's word : "wiiiinnnnd" ➞ "wind"

# user's word : "ttiiitllleeee" ➞ "title"

# user's word : "cccccaaarrrbbonnnnn" ➞ "carbon"
# Notes
# Final strings won’t include words with double letters (e.g. “passing”, “lottery”).
    


userInput = input()
userInput = "ppoeemm"
final = []

for i in userInput:
    print(i)
    if i not in final:
        final.append(i)

    print(final)
