# Exercise 3: Working On A Paragraph
# Find an interesting paragraph of text online. (Please keep it appropriate to the social context of our class.)
# Paste it to your code, and store it in a variable.

text = """Biomolecular computers have great potential for use in intelligent nanomedicine. They allow computation to be performed at the molecular scale, while also interfacing directly with the molecular components of living systems. Nucleic acids are particularly suited for implementing biomolecular computers. They form stable structures that can be inserted into cells, and interactions between species can be precisely controlled in vitro by modifying their nucleotide sequences. The feasibility of using nucleic acids to solve computational problems was demonstrated by Adleman [1], who used DNA to solve an instance of the directed Hamiltonian path problem. Recent work has also highlighted novel therapeutic applications for nucleic acid computers, such as selectively triggering cell death in cancer cells [2].\
As the cost of DNA synthesis continues to decrease [3], significantly more complex DNA computing devices are being constructed [4,5]. As a result, such devices are also becoming increasingly difficult to design by hand, to the point where design automation tools will soon be indispensable. Such tools should allow for modular designs that encapsulate particular motifs, which can be parametrized and easily replicated [6,7]. They should also allow some of the underlying complexity of the molecular interactions to be abstracted away when focusing on high-level design questions, since complex models are more difficult to work with and more computationally expensive to analyse. Once a high-level design has been completed, such tools should allow further complexity to be subsequently reintroduced, in order to obtain a more realistic model of the system's behaviour prior to its physical construction. In this paper, we present a programming language for designing DNA circuits, which meets these criteria. """
